                            was to identify different types of outdoor activities, outdoor activity location 
                        preference, understand people's motivation on involvement with outdoor activities, and generate visual concept 
                    ideas by incorporating AR technologies. As a designer, I wanted to understand people's motivation on adventuring outside,
                    and what they want to accomplish while spending their time outdoors. This quantitative research lead to a wireframing and prototyping 
                    of mobile AR interactive gaming app.

                            design a outdoor mobile app by incorporating Augemented Reality (AR) technology and the live 
                            gaming. For this design choice, we decided to incorporate historical elements where users can perform and accomplish certain mission and earn scores.
                            Users can select NPC character of their choice, find a quest/mission to take and accomplish, earn points as they 
                            finish their quest. The overall goal for this design choice was to bring the entertainment, joy,
                            and courage to the people who are looking to have fun while spending their time outdoors. Although this application design 
                            was heavily influenced by the research of Switchyard park, this game can be played anywhere in any location.

                        to Pokemon Go, NPC character will pop up for interaction and involvement. Camera takes up most of the interface screen 
                    for the safety concern. (having small camera screen interface might make users hard to see). Once users click hide, menu will be 
                shrinked and there will be a full camera screen.     </span></p>

                        <p><span class="standard-text1"> From this project, I took away many important lessons on UX 
                            research and design concepts. This project was done part of a class course project, and was based 
                            on the University's curriculum. However, the curriculum helped me learn important steps of UX processes.
                            Usually in the 
                            first step of UX projects, I previously conducted a user research by directly reaching out to people with user surveys, and interviews. 
                            From this project, I took away another method and ways to understand user's behavior and goals by conducting the 
                            site/location research. Moreover, I was introduced to new research methods such as meaning and form exploration where 
                            we get to dive into the visual images and get to explore different aspects of design.
                             </span></p>


                             <p><span class="standard-text1"> This was my first time being introduced to the AR 
                                 concept design in mobile app project. With my strong interest in PokemonGo, I was always 
                                 interested in designing a live AR game with adventurous missions in it. As a result, I utilized 
                                 Photoshop to carefully edit the NPC character and implemented the NPC in the mobile interface. Furthermore, with 
                                 my previous experiences with Google Maps API, I designed a map feature for this application for users to see. 
                                 After working with the NPC photoshop and analyzing the collection of photo from the photoethnography, I began prototyping 
                                 the entire application using Figma. Overall, I took away some great lessons and tips from UX research to design phase, 
                                 and I strongly believed that this experience will help me understand user's goal, and help me to better process solution for the users.
