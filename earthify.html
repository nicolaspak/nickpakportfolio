                            and its becoming a big global challenge. Some people end up with abundant food but leave a lots of food waste, while some people in the world 
                            are starving. Even today, many people throw away food items and harmful waste without thoughts and consideration. This project examines people's behavior with food waste, and recycling practices. 
                        </span></p>
                        <p><span class="standard-subtitle3"> Solution: </span><span class="standard-text1"> The solution proposed is a mobile application that helps users to 
                            reduce waste and properly manage their waste. When users have left over food item or utensil waste that can be reused, users are able to share the left over items to the people around them and work 
                        benefit from managing their waste properly (potential earnings).  </span></p>

                            conduct competitive analysis, user interviews, behavioral studies, literature review, and create a visual design prototype. 
                            Due to COVID-19 pandemic, this project was impacted by program schedule and many changes were reimplemented.

                         as much? Why is it that there are people who recycle and people who do not recycle? 
                         To seek the solution for people’s behaviour on recycling, 2 team members and I spent 
                         the course of 16 weeks observing, interviewing, gathering, researching and prototyping
                          for the potential product to help people get into better recycling practices. 
                          The project initially started off with the competitive analysis, comparing given 
                          technologies and pain pointing from the technologies that are already being implemented. 
                          Additionally, our team members and I visited the current recycling techniques and technologies
                           that are implemented in a local town in Bloomington, Indiana. We individually visited a local 
                           deli store and got to observe common characteristics of Green Camino, a current recycling practice
                            and methods conducted by the residents of Bloomington Indiana.

                <div class="competitive-analysis-earth">
                    <p>  Initially, I wanted to understand the scope of the 
                        features offered by the current recycling and waste management technology. 
                        What kind of special features do other technologies from other corporate businesses
                         offer? Is it frequently used by other people? Who are the users? 
                         And what are the benefits of the given technology and does it solve any problem? From
                          the competitive market analysis conducted in the earlier phase of the project (Phase 1),
                           I have studied 6 different technologies already being practiced in our daily lives today
                            and highlighted the important features and functionality offered by the technology. To understand,
                        how people practice recycling, and waste management, I decided to conduct an behavioral study tracking 
                    people's movement with wastes. </p>

                        <p> After comparing different markets, technology and features, 
                            I learned that there are fascinating technologies that offer
                             a unique service to users. I learned that many of the technologies
                              are similar in terms of functionality and some of the technologies
                               are targeted for certain waste (i.e ecoATM for e-waste management).
                                After visiting, researching and comparing different
                                 technical features offered by different companies, I came up with the list of questions to myself. 
                                 There are already numerous different technologies where users can apply and use for better waste
                                  management practices. But do people actually recycle in the first place? How often do people
                                   recycle and what are people’s behaviour like? I decided to visit a busy dining hall located in
                                    Luddy Hall, Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. During the visit, I decided to take
                                     detailed notes and draw a pattern to where people travel to. Detailed movement diagram will be shown below.

                               away, about 75% of people (which is the majority of the items thrown away)
                                threw away paper wraps and paper receipts received from the Luddy Hall
                                 cafe. Additionally, people threw away their wooden plates and compostable 
                                 utensils into any bin (no categorising). Lastly, many people threw
                                  away paper cups from Luddy cafe, which was about 10% of the waste. I 
                                  learned that many people in the school environment are in a busy 
                                  situation where many students and faculties do not spend time categorizing 
                                  their waste. Many students ignored the fact that there are compostin
                                  g and recycling bins separately and many people placed their trash 
                                  in any bins they saw on the way.</p>

                            Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engieering at Indiana University, from 12:40 pm to 1:40 pm during 
                            a busy lunch hour. During the observation, I had a paper and pen and started taking detailed notes from the observation. 
                            Throughout the 1 hour period of time, I have witnessed many people rushing to places, and throwing away plastic cups into the 
                            landfill bin, and placing untouched (fresh) food waste into the recycling bin. In order to capture and understand people's movements, 
                            I drew out a diagram of waste bin, recycling bin, people's movement, and objects into a Adobe Illustrator diagram.

                        <p><span class="standard-text1">From this observation and behavior mapping, I learned that people’s behavior
                             differs based on the situation they are in. Starting with the list of items thrown away,
                              about 75% of people (which is the majority of the items thrown away) threw away paper wraps 
                              and paper receipts received from the Luddy Hall cafe. Additionally, people threw away their
                               wooden plates and compostable utensils into any bin (without seperating). Lastly, many people 
                               threw away paper cups from Luddy cafe, which was about 10% of the waste. I learned that many
                                people in the school environment are in a busy situation where many students and faculties
                                 do not spend time categorizing their waste. Many students ignored the fact that there are
                                  composting and recycling bins separately and many people placed their trash in any bins
                                   they saw on the way. </span></p>

                          This application provides both qualitative and quantitative data

                        <p> This research period was when the COVID-19 Pandemic started spreading
                             all over the United States and throughout the world. Since the lockdown
                              and stay at home order, it became very difficult to schedule and meet
                               someone physically during this difficult time. Therefore, I had a chance 
                               to contact someone who has a long history in managing food waste and was
                                able to connect with the person for the possible interviews regarding their
                                 practices in managing their waste. Originally, I spent about 1 hour generating
                                  and coming up with the viable questions. For personal safety and privacy, I 
                                  wanted to make sure all the questions are appropriate questions to ask at
                                   the time and environment they are in. After generating all the questions, 
                                   another idea that I had in mind was the sensor waste bin. The reasoning for
                                    the sensor waste bin was because people would not want to touch anything
                                     that is infected by someone else. Further elaboration is stated below

                                get into a habit of throwing materials away anywhere. (Especially around

                             that many people are ignoring the fact that some of their
                              leftovers are still reusable if they are kept clean and
                               fresh. For the design below, there are 4 options to this
                                app, which makes it simple for users to use. First is the
                                 scanning the waste option. This application would come
                                  with the ideal bin that is associated with this app,
                                   and the bin would be 100% used by the sensor when 
                                   scanned with the QR code (QR Code example is provided
                                    in the “Manage bin & Account” button). This app is 
                                    convenient because users would just have to take the
                                     picture, then the app would automatically detect the
                                      age of the product and determine the quality of the leftover waste).</p>

                        were the factor of timing and accessibility. When people are in a rush and do not have time to handle the junk, I found out that people sometimes place food compost 
                    waste in the recycling bin and throw away recyclable items in the compost bin without further thinking. By incorporating the latest product concept I discovered 
                    in the competitive analysis and literature review, and to connect with user's frustration, I decided to design an app that allows users to 
                    take a picture of their fresh left over items (food waste, utensils waste, and etc) and share those items to nearby people. In order for users to have 
                    go through convenient, reliable, and safe item sharing process, I designed the scan image processing feature for food quality testing, with safe login, signup, and payment feature.

                            proper waste handling, management, and recycling practices. In order to inspire and encourage 
                            users to this effort, I designed a my progress feature that keeps in track of waste handling and management. 
                            Bin management works with the bin that is associated/registered with the application. Using the Arduino sensoring 
                            attached to the bin, users can click compress button and compress all the items that are in the waste bin. Similar concept 
                            outlined in ECube-Labs competitive analysis, this will help to reduce constant waste dumping.

                <div class="programming-changes99">
                    <p> From this project, I closely observed how people practice recycling, and manage waste  
                        in a current environment and society. During this project, I faced many new challenges, 
                    but learned a lot from this experience as a growing UX Researcher & Designer. Professor EunJeong, 
                taught me and 3 other team members a very important lesson on UX Research methods, and how I can 
            apply these process into a real world research with the stakeholders. After learning important UX Research 
        techniques, I started conducting observational behavioral studies, virtual interviews, and documenting literature reviews. 
        Throughout this process, Professor EunJeong slowly guided our team and helped us when we faced any challenges. 
        After investing 7 weeks of our research, we entered into the design phase but many changes were made due to growing 
        COVID-19 crisis.   </p>
                    <p> Originally (as stated in the Overview & Process section), our team was planning on meeting Green Camino (Local recycling management company), 
                        and hear their insights for joint UX research. However, the pandemic has changed all the scheduled plans, and new challenges have arrived. 
                        However, our team decided not to stop and find the best alternative way to come up with the prototype for this research 
                        with only couple weeks remaining. Instead of meeting Green Camino client in person, our team reached out to people to 
                        conduct a virtual interview to hear people's story with their recycling and waste management experience. Each one of our 
                        member documented each process, and began analyzing deeply into the data and insights we collected. Over the time, 
                    I became better and learned a lot on how different UX Research methods can give strong benefits into design prototype to ALL users. 
                     </p>

                     <p> This project was a one of the most special experience. From this experience, I learned how to better understand 
                         all users, and how our team can compromise to one idea and make a impactful mobile application to all varieties of users.
                        In the future, I will remind myself from what I learned from this experience, and find ways to understand user
                        and their experience in a virtual way. </p>
