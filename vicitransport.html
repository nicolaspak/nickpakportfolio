                <p> The literature review from Limelight by <i> Julia Manoukian </i> introduced the ideas of 
                    psychological facts of luxury vehicle buyers. Throughout the article, Manoukian mentioned 
                    couple different psychological facts of luxury vehicle buyers. According to the article, buyers purchase 
                    luxury vehicle experience for self-esteem boost, build quality experience and for status symbol. These 
                    psychological factor makes buyers want to purchase luxury vehicles but not many are accessble due to price and 
                    accessibility (location).

                        <p> I prefer renting luxury cars over just any car because all the high quality service I get to experience 
                            that I can't experience in other regular cars - Nishant, 22 year old </p>

                        <p> I normally rent a car through car rental agencies like AVIS, Hertz and Enterprise. I booked 
                            them through a phone call or booking.com - John, 40 year old</p>
                        
                        <p> I use booking.com or just visit the car rental sites at the airport or 
                            at the city I'm visiting. - Natalia, 56 year old </p>

                        <p> When I book through Turo, the service is usually good but there was one time I booked a car 
                            through Turo and the car was not clean. Since Turo is an app where private owners let you rent 
                            the car, it's hard to trust their service sometimes. - Michael, 30 year old </p>

                        <p> The pro was that the services offered wide variety of prices, locations and different types of cars. 
                            The con was the fact that some cars was not clean, and it is only offered by the private vehicle owners
                        - Ernie: 63 year old </p>

                        <p> The negative condition I had was the overall owner policy. Turo only allows you to drop off the vehicle at the same 
                            location you rented. - Daniel: 29 year old </p>

                <p> <span class="overtitle-1"> Overview: </span><br>
                    I was able to bring 10 participants (Age ranging from 21 - 55) to 
                    Bloomington Wells Library to conduct an interview regarding the food 
                    delivery services such as the UberEats, DoorDash and Grubhub. 
                    The main focus of the interview was to gather feedback on people’s 
                    experience in cooking at home, preparing ingredients for food, 
                    current food delivery services and technology. Before the user 
                    interview process, I analysed and prepared all the appropriate 
                    questions. In the beginning of this user interview process, 
                    I asked 6 participants’ permission for an interview and photography 
                    of the user interview process. This method helped gather rich data and 
                    feedback in people’s experience with how people cook food at home, 
                    how people prepare food at home, food delivery service, food 
                    restriction management, and mobile app interaction. </p>

                <div class="reflection"><p>  This project had major changes throughout the project. Initially, this project was
                    targeted toward Indiana University students only for the testing purposes. Therefore, I focused the market 
                    plans toward IU students only. Through the user interviews, I learned that many people including both
                students and non students are facing challenges in home cooking due to accessibility, timing and financial reasons.
                Although systems like UberEats, DoorDash and GrubHub offers a restaurant delivery, often times people get frustrated on 
                long delivery times, ingredients that they do not want on the food and financial outcomes. In order to make people creative and 
                connected, making food at home, cooking their food without having to worry about accessibilty and finance are important 
            factors and solutions.
                Throughout the project, I learned how to apply user interview to make a better product for the user. I learned how to
            analyze current product (i.e GrubHub, DoorDash and UberEats) and pain point on user's story with the current technology. </p></div>
