                <p> The literature review from Limelight by <i> Julia Manoukian </i> introduced the ideas of 
                    psychological facts of luxury vehicle buyers. Throughout the article, Manoukian mentioned 
                    couple different psychological facts of luxury vehicle buyers. According to the article, buyers purchase 
                    luxury vehicle experience for self-esteem boost, build quality experience and for status symbol. These 
                    psychological factor makes buyers want to purchase luxury vehicles but not many are accessble due to price and 
                    accessibility (location).

                        <p><!-- <span class="vici-person2"> Nishant: </span> --> Below are the key findings from 10 people I interviewed. </p>
                        <p> I prefer renting luxury cars over just any car because all the high quality service I get to experience 
                            that I can't experience in other regular cars - Nishant, 22 year old </p>

                        <p> I normally rent a car through car rental agencies like AVIS, Hertz and Enterprise. I booked 
                            them through a phone call or booking.com - John, 40 year old</p>
                        
                        <p> I use booking.com or just visit the car rental sites at the airport or 
                            at the city I'm visiting. - Natalia, 56 year old </p>

                        <p> When I book through Turo, the service is usually good but there was one time I booked a car 
                            through Turo and the car was not clean. Since Turo is an app where private owners let you rent 
                            the car, it's hard to trust their service sometimes. - Michael, 30 year old </p>

                        <p> The pro was that the services offered wide variety of prices, locations and different types of cars. 
                            The con was the fact that some cars was not clean, and it is only offered by the private vehicle owners
                        - Ernie: 63 year old </p>

                        <p> The negative condition I had was the overall owner policy. Turo only allows you to drop off the vehicle at the same 
                            location you rented. - Daniel: 29 year old </p>

                30km away and found out it was closed. As a result, Alvaro had to spend the night

                        functionality is one of the top use cases. For user's convenience, username and password
                    reset is another important factor to the use cases.</p>

                    being able to cancel/change reservation, price ranges, location, date ranges and reservation history
                are a really important use cases for the customers. Based on the research data, accessibility (location, date,
            and price ranges) were the biggest issue and challenge from the car rental users.</p>
            <p> <span class="usecasebig">Drivers:</span> User profile and cases that determines eligibility. Checking for driver 
                insurance, agreeing to rental agreements, and customer background check is another important factor for this application
                use cases </p>

                        started off this usability testing with consent of the participant. 
                        After discussing the usability testing process and mentioning the details of 
                        the session, our team member asked a brief 
                        question regarding participant's age, occupation, annual income (participant agreed to share 
                      their information), and maritial status. Without documenting their names for personal privacy,
                       our member collected 
                      demographic data from all the participant in order to deeply understand the user's behavior, trend and the interaction
                      flow with the luxury car reservation app. Moreover, our team strongly believed that the 
                    demographic collections are helpful way for us to analyze different feedback from different group of users. </p>

                        usability testing. This participant was tested with our low fidelity
                    prototype and were told to say anything that is in their thought process while
                    navigating through different features. For instance, this participant stated issues 
                    with the profile icon and how it should be adjusted as a drop down menu. Another instance 
                    of result shows how this participant felt about the payment security. After gathering the feedback
                    and the results 
                    from 6 people, our team member was able to analyze all the data that we collected and brainstorm a better

                        <p> Our team wanted to make sure to supply an application that would be user-friendly along with
                            having that ease of use feature. In doing so, we realized some changes needed to be made in
                            order to seamlessly transition from our low fidelity into our high fidelity mockup. During our user
                            testing, our team ran into some problems that need to be changed in order to make a better user
                            experience. Our team got rid of some screens, created additional screens, and changed some
                            existing screens The biggest changes included getting rid of the organize client information
                            screen and in-app messaging. When our participants were doing their user testing they didn’t
                            understand why there would need to be functionality and communication between the vehicle
                            rental company and them. As a team, we decided to get rid of functionality for the car rental
                            companies and communication with them. Instead, we are offering our clients a different way
                            that they can contact the company if need be. Our team decided to place an information tab on each
                            vehicle posting that will include the rental company’s name, address, phone number, and email.
                            This will allow the user to call, text, or email the company with any questions or concerns that
                            users may have. Below shows images of sample high fidelity mockup design and screens. <b> To view the

                    <div class="vicihighfi-img-description2">
                        <p> After analyzing usability test results and discussing with teams on changes, 
                            our teams used Adobe XD to design a high fidelity model of our application.
                            Before designing the high fidelity mockup, our team reviewed our wireframes and our model 
                            of our application from low fidelity model. Then
                        during the high fidelity design session, each one of our team member went over the common
                        UI layout that we all have to follow for a consistent style of design. Then, our team was broken 
                        down into certain sections for feature design. 
                         </p>

                         <p> The image on the left shows high fidelity model of our login/signup screen. Users have 
                             an option to fill in their username and email for profile set up and management. Since this 
                            was our very first UX High fidelity prototyping using Adobe XD, some of our team members 
                        faced challenges in implementing box entry forms, button shapes and color choices. However, our team
                    communicated between each other and we were able to learn different techniques of Adobe XD from each other.
                Below are some example images of high fidelity prototype. To view the full version of Adobe XD High Fidelity prototype,

                            <p> The images show variety of high fidelity model interface of our application. 
                                Starting from the very top image on the left to very bottom right image, the background
                                color chosen for this process is pink (changed later in implementation). The top row images 
                                show how selection of cars can look like in the application interface. The selection of car 
                                screen shows picture of each cars, price, and location followed with select vehicle button. 
                                Moreover in the third row of images, the interface image shows consistent design of the UI layout
                                in the bottom of the interface (i.e Book Now, Profile, Reservation History, and etc) when navigating
                                through different pages. Example shows how users can simply change reservation, and navigate over to "Book Now"
                                section by tapping on one of buttons below. Finally, the bottom row of interface image shows how users 
                                can filter their options by price ranges with dropdown menus. These functionality and design was highly 
                                considered during the high fidelity mockups because our team wanted to implement quick and most convenient 
                                and accessible way of booking possible for the users.

                    <div class="programming-changes2">
                        <p> From our very first high fidelity prototype experience using Adobe XD, our team received a feedback from variety 
                            of people including participants from low fidelity prototype/testing. Users have pointed out that 
                        all functionality within the app was very well displayed and conveniently accessible to all users. In terms of design, 
                        our team has received couple of points of improvement. <b> First was the consistent color scheme and color choice 
                    practices. </b> The pink background with white color typography and fonts made some color blind users hard to see. Moreover, 
                some users pointed out that the pink background with white colored font made the application too flashy. Another major feedback was 
                consistent color theme/design practices. Some users pointed out that in the UI Buttons below had too many different colors and design practices
            were not consistent. Instead, some users recommended choosing 2-3 colors at maximum and utilizing those 2-3 color as a background, 
        typography, and for other designs. Another major change between the high fidelity prototype and implementation phase was the usage of <b> login/sign up system. </b> 
        The high fidelity model of our application displayed manual login/sign up using username and password formation. Our manager has pointed out that 
        login/sign up data set up can take a long time, and implementing Facebook or Gmail login instead would save up a lot of time in development 
    process. Moreover, our manager (potential user) has pointed out the convenient Facebook setting management system where users can easily manage 
    credential settings through other media platforms (i.e resetting password through Facebook and etc). With those 2 major feedback in mind, our team moved onto the 
programming implementation phase. </p>

                    <div class="programming-changes2">
                    <p> Most of our team members had few experience or no experience with Swift/XCode. 
                        However, collaboration was the key, and we were able to meet, and watch Youtube tutorials on 
                    some of the basic XCode concepts. Just like the research process, our team started off the program & implementation
                process by identifying our needs and problems. For instance, not everybody in our team was an expert in XCode. Therefore, 
            we began listing down what we need for our initial implementation, and code. Then, some of our members learned that we need to have 
        certain version of Mac software in order to get started, some of our members learned that we need to download Cocoapods for API implementation, 
    and some of our members learned that they needed to have command terminal downloaded for database/git purposes. For the first couple weeks, all of our 
team members started teaching each other Git basics, programming basics, and database development basics. After our lessons and enhancing our basic knowledge 
in programming, we began looking at our Agile sheet and began working on our part.   </p>

                    <div class="programming-changes2">
                        <p> As mentioned in the changes section, our team learned that user login/sign up and payment feature 
                            can be easily implemented by using some of the existing application APIs. The image on the top left shows initial API download process of
                        implementing Cocoapods in our XCode platform. After implementing Cocoapods feature in XCode platform, our team started 
                    utilizing Sandbox PayPal software and PayPal developer account to implement convenient payment feature in this application for the users. 
                    After the successful implementation of payment feature in this application, users are able to pay their amount without a hassle or worrying about their 
                privacy. The image on the left shows how users are navigated to the PayPal page after clicking the "Book and Pay" button. Once users land on 
            the PayPal page, users are able to manage their payment option with credit card or the debit card. Another API that our team used 
            for our application is the Facebook API. Facebook API implementation was a same process as PayPal API implementation process. More images are displayed below.  </p>

                    <div class="programming-changes2">
                        <p> Throughout the programming and implementation process, our team considered the consistent 
                            design style and practices by keeping only few colors as a background and typography. Moreover, 
                            we wanted to make sure our font and description outlined in the application is legible to all users.
                            Along with the consistent design and typography practices, our team also took consideration of conveniences
                            within navigating through different parts of the application. For user's convenience, our team has successfully 
                            implemented the Facebook login process for users to login and manage their account. Furthermore, all payments done 
                            through this application is done through PayPal account, where users can simply enter their debit card, or PayPal 
                            information for future purchases. 
                         </p>

                         <p> Another most important feature our team implemented in this application is the selection by dates, location, and 
                             price range option. From our research, our team learned that accessibility and affordability is a major key issue that 
                             users go through. In order to help users to access luxury vehicle at their convenient location, dates, and price range, 
                             our team implemented the location filter, date filter and price range filter functionality to help users access the vehicle. 
                         </p>

                         <p> Overall, the Research, Design, Product Management and Software Development process took 8 months of 
                            work between the team of 4 people. Our team accomplished the goal of mastering the XCode skills, Adobe Creative Suit skills, 
                            and product management skills using Agile. </p>

                    and a great problem solver. Prior to this project, I never had any experience in any prototype tools, product management using
                Agile, software development using XCode/Swift, low fidelity design and usability testing. In the very beginning, I felt excited, 
            and nervous at the same time. However, I strongly believed that this project and this experience would help me prepare for my future career,
        and shape who I am as a UX Designer in the future. </p>

                    <p> There were many ups and downs through out this project. Some of our team mate faced major challenges in software development,
                        which made them lose interest to continue on this project. As a result, our manager started off by scolding at our team, and 
                        stating that we are not going to be able to accomplish this project. That is when our team learned the lesson, and decided not 
                        to give up. Every Wednesday and Sunday, our team gathered together and started watching Youtube tutorials on Swift basics, 
                        Agile basics, and data structure basics. Whenever we were stuck and faced a difficult time configuring our code or designing 
                        our application, we reached out to one another and helped one another. Every week, we started understanding the XCode basics,
                    and process, which lead to completing more lines of code, and compiling. Even after we started picking up on basic concept of Swift, and 
                    other software skills, our professor and manager kept telling us that "you are behind from other teams". However we didn't quit.</p>

                    <p> Starting from the research process, our team wanted to deeply focus on the users and understand what users think and feel of the 
                        existing technology. While some of our team members got started on the user research, I started investing my time into reviewing 
                        any technical challenges, and prepared for any technical challenges so I could help rest of our team members. First, I downloaded the 
                        XCode, Command terminal, and got familiarized with Git basic functionalities through Youtube tutorial and helpful books. After downloading
                        all the hardware on my computer, I helped downloading all these hardware to our teammates' computer. As a result, our team saved up 
                        a lot of time by helping each other from the start. After downloading and familiarizing all the hardware tools and software tools, our team
                        finished all the research and began analyzing all the data using all the research methods. For many members in our team, they were new to the 
                        whole UX research process. With the past experience I had with UX research and design, I began assisting others by reviewing some of the 
                        UX research method and by teaching them some of the basic process of UX. 
                    </p>

                    <p> Moving onto the design phase, which was on the 16th week of this project, many of our team members were new to the low fidelity wireframing 
                        and high fidelity mockup software tools like Adobe XD. Just like the research phase, I began giving our team members some tips and 
                    started teaching them basic UX Design principles with the past experience I had. We did a lot of practice runs so that all of our team members 
                can get used to and become familiarize with the low fidelity and high fidelity mockup design practices. After couple of practices, all of our team members 
            were able to come up with mockup designs and showcase our high fidelity design to our manager and our users (usability testing participants). As a result of collaborating,
        communicating, and assisting others who are in need, our team received an A+ in our design projects and assignments. </P>

                    
                
                    <p> Our team entered the programming and implementation phase on January 2020. Over the 2 weeks winter break period, our team spent time learning and familiarizing 
                        XCode basics. I first downloaded the Cocoapods then helped rest of our team download Cocoapods due to their hardware issues. In the first couple of weeks, 
                        our team spent time implementing Facebook user login feature with profile management and settings. After the user profile and login settings, 
                    our team spent time working on price range filter, date filter, and location filter functionality. Then in March 2020, COVID-19 hit, which 
                affected our team progress and process. However we did not stop there. Our team utilized Zoom conference call to manage our team progress and continued working 
            on PayPal functionalities and reservation history feature at home. </p> 

                        <p> Overall, this project was long, challenging but rewarding project. Our team learned how to collaborate, during the most 
                            difficult time with COVID-19 pandemic, our team learned how to compromise our idea when nobody agreed to one idea, and our team learned 
                            how to problem solve during the time when we were stuck. As a result of this project, our team learned how to conduct real world user research, 
                            how to product manage using tools such as Scrum, learned how to create a high fidelity mockups using Adobe XD tools and program a mobile 
                            application using XCode.
