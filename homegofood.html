                <p> Food delivery systems and restaurant order are becoming convenient in the 21st century as mobile technology is advancing. <p><br>

                <p>    When it comes to ordering food and looking for food, how often do people actually 
                    want to eat the food from the restaurant? If people eat/order food from restaurants 
                    often, why is it that people order food instead of cooking at home? Do people actually 
                    know how to cook food? For people who want to cook food at home, can people find the 
                    right resources and information on the recipe? Is there a way to become better at cooking 
                    and share with other people about your recipe? </p>

                <p> Today, there are food delivery services such as UberEats, GrubHub, and
                     DoorDash that delivers restaurant meals from the restaurant to people’s home.
                      With the food delivery services, users do not have to leave their home or
                       call the restaurants for food delivery details. The current food delivery
                        services’ user group is limited to people who are wanting to order meals from the restaurants, 
                        University dining halls and some food truck meals. With home cooked meal sharing services, the user not only gets their food delivered instantly,
                     but also gets to learn each other's recipe and immerse themselves into the 
                     creative cooking world. For instance, a busy 30 year old man who never has ingredients
                      at home due to busy day at work can order ingredients from people around him and learn about special 
                      recipes from other people around the area. <p> <br>

                <p> <span class="overtitle"> Overview: </span><br>
                    I was able to bring 10 participants (Age ranging from 21 - 55) to 
                    Bloomington Wells Library to conduct an interview regarding the food 
                    delivery services such as the UberEats, DoorDash and Grubhub. 
                    The main focus of the interview was to gather feedback on people’s 
                    experience in cooking at home, preparing ingredients for food, 
                    current food delivery services and technology. Before the user 
                    interview process, I analysed and prepared all the appropriate 
                    questions. In the beginning of this user interview process, 
                    I asked 6 participants’ permission for an interview and photography 
                    of the user interview process. This method helped gather rich data and 
                    feedback in people’s experience with how people cook food at home, 
                    how people prepare food at home, food delivery service, food 
                    restriction management, and mobile app interaction. </p>

                <p> I’m either at work or at school taking courses during the day so when I come home, I become tired and sometimes don’t have enough energy to go grocery shopping </p>
                    
                <p> I usually eat cereals, milk and egg in the morning and I would have to rush through the breakfast </p>

                <p> From the user overview, I learned that there are 3 key factors that
                    distracts user from cooking at home. The three main factor were the 
                accessibility, timing and finance. Many people pointed out the accessibility 
            for the distance between their residence and nearest grocery stores. Furthermore,
            people pointed out the lack of timing they have for personal cooking at home. For the mock-up initial design,
            the name of the website is named the Bloomington Go Food. </p><br><br><br>

                <div class="reflection"><p>  This project had major changes throughout the project. Initially, this project was
                    targeted toward Indiana University students only for the testing purposes. Therefore, I focused the market 
                    plans toward IU students only. Through the user interviews, I learned that many people including both
                students and non students are facing challenges in home cooking due to accessibility, timing and financial reasons.
                Although systems like UberEats, DoorDash and GrubHub offers a restaurant delivery, often times people get frustrated on 
                long delivery times, ingredients that they do not want on the food and financial outcomes. In order to make people creative and 
                connected, making food at home, cooking their food without having to worry about accessibilty and finance are important 
            factors and solutions.
                Throughout the project, I learned how to apply user interview to make a better product for the user. I learned how to
            analyze current product (i.e GrubHub, DoorDash and UberEats) and pain point on user's story with the current technology. </p></div>
