                    <p><span class="standard-subtitle3"> Problem: </span> <span class="standard-text1"> Throughout the past couple of years, many people started using mobile app such as UberEats, 
                    DoorDash, and GrubHub for food delivery. However, these mobile delivery can be costly, and sometimes difficult for many young adults 
                to financially afford them. Many adults continue to face challenges in accessing resources to food ingredients, recipes, and affordability. </span>  </p>
                <p><span class="standard-subtitle3"> Solution: </span> <span class="standard-text1"> The solution proposed is a social media type web application that allows 
                    people to learn, purchase food, purchase ingredients, and share food between other people in the community. User can search for ingredients, 
                    search for people, and buy/purchase food and ingredients from other people.

                <p> Today, there are food delivery services such as UberEats, GrubHub, and
                     DoorDash that delivers restaurant meals from the restaurant to people’s home.
                      With the food delivery services, users do not have to leave their home or
                       call the restaurants for food delivery details. The current food delivery
                        services’ user group is limited to people who are wanting to order meals from the restaurants, 
                        University dining halls and some food truck meals. With home cooked meal sharing services, the user not only gets their food delivered instantly,
                     but also gets to learn each other's recipe and immerse themselves into the 
                     creative cooking world. For instance, a busy 30 year old man who never has ingredients
                      at home due to busy day at work can order ingredients from people around him and learn about special 
                      recipes from other people around the area. <p> <br>

                               analysed and prepared all the appropriate questions. This method helped gather rich data

                        <p><span class="standard-text1"> I conducted an user interview to 5 people ranging from age 19 to age 55. Some interviewers 
                            are in college, and some interviewers are adults (young and old). Most people stated that they face challenges in 
                        timing and affordability of food ingredients/cooking (i.e finding time to go to the store when they are busy). Some people stated that 
                          ordering food at a restaurant is expensive. More details will be covered in the research findings section.</span></p>

                <p> From the user overview, I learned that there are 3 key factors that
                    distracts user from cooking at home. The three main factor were the 
                accessibility, timing and finance. Many people pointed out the accessibility 
            for the distance between their residence and nearest grocery stores. Furthermore,
            people pointed out the lack of timing they have for personal cooking at home. For the mock-up initial design,
            the name of the website is named the Bloomington Go Food. </p><br><br><br>

                  there is a <b>cuisine page</b> for users to view different types of cuisine made by other users,
                    thers is a <b>recipe book page</b> for users to view different recipe guide for each meal, and 
                    there is a  <b>share page</b> for users to share their cooked meals to other people. Lastly, there is a <b>
                        settings page </b> for users to adjust their preferences. Throughout the home page, there is a 
                        welcome message that helps users to view latest trends of this website. </p><br>

                            unique cultures around the world and learn more about global culinary history & trends.

                        <p><span class="standard-text1"> This project was my first UX/HCI project I've ever conducted. This was my first time 
                            conducting user research using user interview and experiencing UX projects in an advanced level. Overall, I have learned 
                            many new skills as a UX designer. In user research interview, I learned how to gather and analyze data by framing the 
                        key issues that users are facing. Then, I learned how to examine the key problems that users are facing in daily life in eating habits and learned 
                    how to apply those key takings to preliminary sketches. I was able to generate concepts and ideas from the key issues highlighted, 
                which lead me to the low fidelity drawings of UI components, and come to the design decisions for the users. </span></p><br>

                <p><span class="subtitle-standard4"> Key Takeaways </span></p>
                <p><span class="standard-text1"> I was given a feedback that some of the website visuals and layouts are not following the current design standards. In order 
                    to determine the issue of the design and understand the feedback, I went back to the final prototype and reflected upon the design 
                choices I made. I learned that some of the typography choices made hard for some users to read and learned that color choices were not up to 
            current design standards. In order to fix these issues and to learn better, I searched on Google, 2019 UX trends and took away some great advices, and visual inspiration 
        from different resources. I started accepting where I am as a UX Designer and my skills, and decided to aim toward learning more about UX principles, and visual UI trends from inspirational resources. </span></p>

                <div class="reflection"><p>  This project had major changes throughout the project. Initially, this project was
                    targeted toward Indiana University students only for the testing purposes. Therefore, I focused the market 
                    plans toward IU students only. Through the user interviews, I learned that many people including both
                students and non students are facing challenges in home cooking due to accessibility, timing and financial reasons.
                Although systems like UberEats, DoorDash and GrubHub offers a restaurant delivery, often times people get frustrated on 
                long delivery times, ingredients that they do not want on the food and financial outcomes. In order to make people creative and 
                connected, making food at home, cooking their food without having to worry about accessibilty and finance are important 
            factors and solutions.
                Throughout the project, I learned how to apply user interview to make a better product for the user. I learned how to
            analyze current product (i.e GrubHub, DoorDash and UberEats) and pain point on user's story with the current technology. </p></div>
