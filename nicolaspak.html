                <p> I'm a Product Designer, Content Strategist and Researcher, who recently graduated from 
                    Indiana University Bloomington. I majored in Informatics and minored in
                     Human Computer Interaction. I also specialized in Computer Science, Machine Learning and 
                     Product Management. 
                      </p>

                <p> My life as an interaction designer started in the summer of 2018, when I started a PM internship at 
                    Nube9, a start up company in Seattle. Throughout the internship, I worked closely with the software engineers,
                     and designers to help create a roadmap for the product and for the success. From the Internship, I began tasting
                     my love and passion in design, and began investing my time to design work. </p>

                    <p> Since the fall of 2018, I am a part of Indiana University Healthcare Journey IU HCI team. 
                        IU Healthcare Journey is a healthcare Informatics research team, helping mothers in pregancy in rural Indiana counties where healthcare
                        system is not easily accessible. Throughout my involvement, I conducted a research and interviews throught the mothers in Indiana,
                        brainstormed the best product for resources accessibility and designed/developed a website for the mothers who
                        are looking for healthcare resources. In the fall of 2019, I established a UX Design and Research club at Indiana 
                        University, to help all students to fulfill their interest and gain their skills as a UX researcher and UX designer. 
                    </p>

                    <p> I was born in South Korea and I read, write and speak 3 fluent languages. Korean, English and French.
                        My favorite hobby is traveling, bike riding, and hiking. In my freetime, I travel to places I have 
                        never been to spend time documenting videos, and writing reviews.
