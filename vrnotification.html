                            technologies' notification systems. This project is focused on examining people's behavior with notification system and redesigning notification management 
                        system content with wearable devices such as wearable glasses and watches.     </span></p>

                            different haptic and tone.

                         There are many different devices users use, such as iPhone, Android, Android tablets, iPads, 
                         iPod Touch, and etc.  </span> </p><br>

                    <p><span class="inquirysummarytitle"> Summary </span></p>

                    <p><span class="inquirysummary"> Our topic space of push notification management led us to decide on a focus group targeting busy individuals with
                         many commitments, who may benefit from the organization of their notifications. We also thought to extend
                          it to include avid social media users, but our main focus were individuals with a busy schedule. Each of us brought one person that 
                          met the criteria of being a busy individual who has intense schedules that involve managing organizations, school, jobs, and etc. 
                          If we couldn't find someone to fit that criteria, then we would have someone who engaged with social media regularly brought in as a replacement, 
                          so we could hear their thoughts and perspective on the matter. Each of us happened to know students from IU who were either involved in many 
                          different activities on campus or consistently used social media. The focus group took place on Tuesday, October 29th in 
                          a secluded conference room at Nicolas's apartment complex at 9:30 at night. The meeting took approximately 45 minutes and we joined our subjects at

                    how they deal with them. It gave us different perspectives on how they usually deal with push

                <p>
                    
                 <b>Pros:</b>
                 Long conversation that was in depth about our topic and gave us feedback and what we should and should not implement. 
                 Made us think of other ideas that would complement our project. </p><br>
                     
                 <p>
                 <b>Cons:</b>
                 occasionally, a subject who was speaking would get interrupted, which didn't 
                 allow them to complete their thoughts on a specific matter in the discussion.

                    we assigned a moderator to go over the instructions for the card sorting session. The overall goal was to generate options for features, contents, and 
            information to create a better way to manage notifications.     </span></p>

                        <p><span class="standard-text1"> After the card sorting session, our team learned that users have categorized list of features by level of 
                            importance and priority levels. Cards are categorized by one, two, and three stars with one being least important to three being the most important. 
                            The three star notes were mostly features that are related to privacy, psychology, and security impact. Two star notes were mainly functionality features 
                            and convenience. One star notes (least important) were mainly features that are less impactful to users (i.e GPS notifications, gaming notifications, and etc).

                                him. He has been using his iPhone for the past couple years and he has many
                                 problems for notifications. If David puts his iPhone to mute, he would get annoyed
                                    because there are so many notifications that need to be handled right away.
                                     After the meeting, he views his numerous text messages and emails from his
                                      friends, family, and other important people. There are so many new messages
                                       that he needs to send to important people that he forgets to respond to his manager. 
                                       He is facing frustrations and he is looking for a better way to view his notifications.</p>

                                      Blake responds to all his text messages. After his response to all his notifications, he

                    <p> From mindmapping, the key points our group has pointed out were <b> psychology, usability 
                        and functionality. </b> From the card sorting and idea prioritisation, we believed that 
                    while feature functionality, aesthetics and demographics are important factors, nothing is more
                    important than <b> safety, privacy and security </b> of the users.   </p><br>

                    <p> Before crafting paper prototype, our group discussed about best way to keep users safe from 
                        privacy, health and distractions. In addition, our group discussed about best ways to handle
                        the interface with the VR glass. After discussing safety and privacy/security, I brought an appropriate
                        tool for low fidelity model production.</p>

                <div class="lowfiapproach">
                    <p><span class="demoquotes"> Approach & Design </span></p>
                    <p> From the key takeaways, we learned that nothing is more important than the safety, privacy and 
                        security of the users when using the product. Therefore, we decided to implemented a user account and login feature 
                        for personal profile setting, user setting and privacy preference settings. That way, users may feel more 
                        safe with the product when using them in public. </p>

                    <p> Our team decided to implement a scroll with eyes
                        functionality. Reasoning for eye scroll functionality is because
                        of personal space safety. For instance, if a person is using a public transportation in a crowded space and moves 
                        around with hand gestures, then other person may get hit and distract the personal space. Therefore, our team
                        considered personal space safety and decided to implement safe eye scroll functionality 
                        for the product. </p>

                        gesture functionality if users feel safe moving around their hands in the open space (less crowded space). With the 
                    safety and privacy considered in this low fidelity prototyping, we have moved onto the next stage of this research, which is the usability testing. </span> </p>

                        <p> On the main screen, users are able to view and modify notifications in

                        <p> Example when user clicks on certain application for notification management (Instagram example).
                            Within Instagram, users can select the checkbox to choose Instagram notifications that are important to them 
                        and move them into the priorities folder.  </p>

                        <p> Within the priority folder, users can remove certain notification if the users think the notification
                            isn't important. Once the notification modification is complete, users
                        can now click back to view or add more notifications to the folder.  </p>

                <div class="programming-changes3">
                <p> Throughout this project development process, I contributed to the project development
                     process equally along with the team members. I helped to design the mind map along with our
                      team members and I helped to create a storyboard and low fidelity mockups for our digital glass
                       lens interface. For the design process, I created a physical glass prototype using scissors, tape,
                        cardboard and clear paper. For the high fidelity mockups, I created a digital interface lens prototype
                         using the Adobe XD design tools and prototypes. Lastly with the wizard of oz method, I
                          helped our team members to generate set of a task for users to perform and our team members were able to 
                          contribute to the final project equally. Throughout the semester, I learned how to perform necessary UX research 
                          skills on the user focused research and in the future, I will be using the research skills I learned in this class for 
                          my masters HCI course and future UX jobs.</p>

                            about user centered design. This was my very first UX group project and this experience was a very rewarding project where I got 
                            to closely examine user's behavior and frustrations through user research methods and synthesis. When we approached the design phase, 
                            we found out that some of the design ideas didn't agree with each other. However, we reminded ourselves that what we are building is to 
                            impact and advocate the users. As a result, our team hosted a group meeting more often and took this opportunity to learn team work exprience, 
                            and collaboration skills, which are very important skills to have for future full time UX opportunities.

                        <p><span class="standard-text1"> During the design phase, I was exposed to the Figma tool for the first time. While I was working 
                            on the high fidelity prototype, I also started practicing Figma prototyping and even watched Youtube tutorials on Figma tricks, and animation 
                            tricks. While I was practicing, I strongly believed that practicing visual UI skills would be really helpful for future professional opportunities. 
                            With all the problem solving skills and teamwork skills I contributed to this project, I felt accomplished and became interested in learning more about 
                            UX processes.
