                <p> Over the past 3 decades, the way we communicate, interact and respond to daily reminders, messages and tasks have changed drastically. In the 1990s, we responded to our communication by beeping pagers, then it moved onto answering text messages using hand motion/gestures. Since the first introduction of the smartphone, people now read and  tap on the flat screen to respond to the notifications and reminders. Technologies are continuing to evolve and 
                    there are new technological devices coming up every year with different features/functionality. <p><br>

                <p><span class="deep-context">However, 3154 people have been killed and 424,000 people have been injured in 2013 by smartphone notification distractions while driving.  </span> </p><br>
                    
                <p>It is now time to reduce the injury/fatality caused by smartphone distraction, and with the new introduction and new practices with VR technology, there needs to be a better way to view personal notification and avoid distractions. </p>

                    <p><span class="inquirytitledescription"> Initially as a group, we wanted to hear the user's voice and thoughts on the current notification systems.
                         There are many different devices users use, such as iPhone, Android, Android tablets, iPads, 
                         iPod Touch, and etc.  </span> </p><br>

                    <p><span class="inquirysummary"> Our topic space of push notification management led us to decide on a focus group targeting busy individuals with
                         many commitments, who may benefit from the organization of their notifications. We also thought to extend
                          it to include avid social media users, but our main focus were individuals with a busy schedule. Each of us brought one person that 
                          met the criteria of being a busy individual who has intense schedules that involve managing organizations, school, jobs, and etc. 
                          If we couldn't find someone to fit that criteria, then we would have someone who engaged with social media regularly brought in as a replacement, 
                          so we could hear their thoughts and perspective on the matter. Each of us happened to know students from IU who were either involved in many 
                          different activities on campus or consistently used social media. The focus group took place on Tuesday, October 29th in 
                          a secluded conference room at Nicolas's apartment complex at 9:30 at night. The meeting took approximately 45 minutes and we joined our subjects at 
                          the table to ask them questions and observe them discussing these topics. </span></p><br>

                <p> During our focus group, we each brought someone to ask questions pertaining to our project idea and what they thought about it as well as ask 
                    them about their daily schedule and how push notifications and daily reminders affect them. </p><br>
                    
                <p> We also asked what helps them out in keeping track of them, as well as which ones are the most distracting, getting a consensus on how they deal with them usually. </p><br>

                    We were able to get a great amount of information pertaining to how users view push notifications and 
                    how they deal with them. It gave us different perspectives on how they usually deal with push 
                    notifications and reminders. </p><br>


            

                <p>
                    
                 <b>Pros:</b>
                 Long conversation that was in depth about our topic and gave us feedback and what we should and should not implement. 
                 Made us think of other ideas that would complement our project. </p><br>
                     
                 <p>
                 <b>Cons:</b>
                 occasionally, a subject who was speaking would get interrupted, which didn't 
                 allow them to complete their thoughts on a specific matter in the discussion.

                          unique concept with VR glass technology and notification management. Mind mapping was a great
                           way to visualise different aspects of the project and build new ideas upon another. As each
                            individual member began listing down different concepts, we connected each topic to list out
                             the similarity and relevance between different topics. Finally, our group and I were able to
                              distinguish and consider three topics that would be important to the project development

                                him. He has been using his iPhone for the past couple years and he has many
                                 problems for notifications. If David puts his iPhone to mute, he would get annoyed
                                    because there are so many notifications that need to be handled right away.
                                     After the meeting, he views his numerous text messages and emails from his
                                      friends, family, and other important people. There are so many new messages
                                       that he needs to send to important people that he forgets to respond to his manager. 
                                       He is facing frustrations and he is looking for a better way to view his notifications.</p>

                    <p><span class="demoquotes"> Key Takeaways From Research </span></p>
                    <p> From mindmapping, the key points our group has pointed out were <b> psychology, usability 
                        and functionality. </b> From the card sorting and idea prioritisation, we believed that 
                    while feature functionality, aesthetics and demographics are important factors, nothing is more
                    important than <b> safety, privacy and security </b> of the users.   </p><br>

                    <p> Before crafting paper prototype, our group discussed about best way to keep users safe from 
                        privacy, health and distractions. In addition, our group discussed about best ways to handle
                        the interface with the VR glass. After discussing safety and privacy/security, I brought an appropriate
                        tool for low fidelity model production.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="lowfiapproach">
                    <p><span class="demoquotes"> Approach & Design </span></p>
                    <p> From the key takeaways, we learned that nothing is more important than the safety, privacy and 
                        security of the users when using the product. Therefore, we decided to implemented a user account and login feature 
                        for personal profile setting, user setting and privacy preference settings. That way, users may feel more 
                        safe with the product when using them in public. </p>

                    <p> Our team decided to implement a scroll with eyes
                        functionality. Reasoning for eye scroll functionality is because
                        of personal space safety. For instance, if a person is using a public transportation in a crowded space and moves 
                        around with hand gestures, then other person may get hit and distract the personal space. Therefore, our team
                        considered personal space safety and decided to implement safe eye scroll functionality 
                        for the product. </p>

                            users are able to set up their profile and read about
                        the safety and privacy policies before moving forward. </p>

                        <p> Once user sets up the account, users will once be asked to
                            agree with the safety and privacy policies with the device before
                            activating the glass. </p>

                        <p> On the main screen, users are able to view and modify notifications in 
                            the level of priorities. There are high. medium, and low fidelity notification
                            folders where users can cateogize them with the level of importance.</p>

                        <p> For the user's safety and comfort, the interface of the glass is empty. If users 
                            want to perform certain actions with the device, users can use their fingers to complete
                            certain task within the device </p>

                        <p> Example when user clicks on certain application for notification management (Instagram example).
                            Within Instagram, users can select the checkbox to choose Instagram notifications that are important to them 
                        and move them into the priorities folder.  </p>

                        <p> Within the priority folder, users can remove certain notification if the users think the notification
                            isn't important. Once the notification modification is complete, users
                        can now click back to view or add more notifications to the folder.  </p>

                            user interface interaction flow and helped to design best interface for the users. </p>

                <p> Throughout this project development process, I contributed to the project development
                     process equally along with the team members. I helped to design the mind map along with our
                      team members and I helped to create a storyboard and low fidelity mockups for our digital glass
                       lens interface. For the design process, I created a physical glass prototype using scissors, tape,
                        cardboard and clear paper. For the high fidelity mockups, I created a digital interface lens prototype
                         using the Adobe XD design tools and prototypes. Lastly with the wizard of oz method, I
                          helped our team members to generate set of a task for users to perform and our team members were able to 
                          contribute to the final project equally. Throughout the semester, I learned how to perform necessary UX research 
                          skills on the user focused research and in the future, I will be using the research skills I learned in this class for 
                          my masters HCI course and future UX jobs.</p>
