                        <p><span class="superexp"> Super Purposes website was first launched in 2018 as a career coaching startup company. 
                            When this website was first launched, there were no emphasis on User research and design. 
                            2 years later, the website is displayed with the same design and same typography as 2 years ago with no customer attraction. In 2020, 
                            many young adults and career seekers are facing difficult time preparing for career opportunities.
                            In September 2020, I stepped in, along with 6 other UX researchers to conduct user research to
                             gather user's experience with job posting sites and hear user’s insights on the website. Our team is currently still in research phase gathering 
                             surveys and conducting interviews. Due to the non disclosure agreement, I am not able to provide any details on this project until 
                             this project is published publicly. This project is in progress and please send me an email if you have any questions.  </span> </p>

                                While working on the surveys, and initial phase of those objectives, a lot of our
                                 employees were still facing challenges in the communication system, senior web designers 
                                 needed UX researchers to focus on the web page optimization, and the developers needed
                                  immediate help from the UX researchers with the campaign page for analysis. Our team discussed
                                   and learned that there are too many projects thrown into a short period of time, and decided 
                                   to span time narrowing down our goal one by one.

                            first UX project in a corporate setting. As a result, many of our team member faced 
                        challenges in understanding the meaning of UX and what we are aiming for. After group discussions and 
                        meetings, our team learned that we are doing this project to advocate the  
                    users and not just our team. In this fast paced environment, our team initially spent time understanding 
                    the value of UX, and understanding our goals, target, and objectives rather than focusing on individual skills.

                             initially started off this research by taking time to understand where we are
                              at and where we are as a company. Some of the UX researchers were new to the
                               corporate experience, and some of the researchers had 7 years of UX experiences. 
                               Regardless of our skills and experiences, we began to accept where we stand in 
                               UX and decided to collaborate as a team. We began understanding where the company
                                is at. As a team, we began to think about where our company is at in terms of branding,
                                 marketing, and design. The points we covered were, “If there is something missing from
                                  our company, what would it be, and what does our company provide so far?”.  </span></p><br>

                            After understanding our values, and progress, we began conducting research on the users and the company.
                             To start off, we began this process by generating user personas to have a rough
                              understanding of potential user’s frustration, goals, needs, and behavior. Moreover, our
                               team also generated user surveys to identify user’s experience, and insights on the current
                                model of the website. While the user surveys are conducted, our team is conducting research
                                 on the company to identify business requirements, and narrowed down goals for the company.

In order to have a better understanding with the user's insight, our team did not provide any forms of critiques or directions during the survey session.
